# Auto install Seafile Server CE* and PRO**

These installers offer a quick and easy way to set up a production ready Seafile Server using MariaDB, Memcached and NGINX as a reverse proxy in under 5 minutes.

\* Community Edition
** Professional Edition

## What's it for?
Install the [Seafile Server](http://seafile.com/en/home/) in a standard and more secure manner then our current out of the box setup scripts offer. Instead of SQLite we're using MariaDB and NGINX instead of Gunicorn.


## Why?
There are too many ways to misconfigure a manual Seafile server installation. We've noticed that many people don't realize that the default installation is very unsafe. In other cases people get stuck during the manual installation procedure or forget a step like changing `FILE_SERVER_ROOT` or use IP addresses instead of resolvable DNS names.

The scripts are derived from our [reference installation for Seafile Server Professional](https://wiki.seafile.de/tutorials/debian_8_jessie_64bit). They help us to standardize the installation procedure and identifying setup errors more easily.

## Supported OS

Just select the corresponding installer for your OS. All scripts are meant to run with the bare minimum OS setup. We strongly suggest not installing Seafile server besides desktop environment or hosting panels like Plesk, ISPConfig, etc. Professional installations which don't follow our setup suggestions, don't qualify for official support. Keep this in mind.

## Caution
Never run these scripts on a production server. They are more or less a one trick pony and could seriously damage production systems. Run it only once and
delete it afterwards. If something goes wrong, restart with a fresh machine.

As a precaution I have added a few simple checks to abort installation if any of these fails:

1. Check if you're running this script as root. If not, abort.
2. Check if the user "seafile" exists. If yes, abort.
3. Check if the directory "/opt/seafile" exists. If yes, abort.

## FAQs

***Where do I find the full installation log?***
At `/root/[installer_name]_installation.log`

***What's the unprivileged Seafile users name***
seafile

***How can I change the domain name of the Seafile server?***
Run the `seafile-server-change-address` script on the shell

***How can I login as the unprivileged Seafile user?***
Run `su - seafile -s /bin/bash` with root privileges on the shell

***How do I update Seafile?***
You will have to handle Seafile updates/upgrades manually after the initial installation. Consult http://manual.seafile.com/deploy/upgrade.html on how to upgrade Seafile.

To login as the Seafile users run `su - seafile -s /bin/bash` and then proceed with the update procedure as usual.

BTW: Ideas on how to automate upgrades are very welcome!

***What do I have to do after the installer has finished?***
1. Delete installer script. You wont need it anymore and might even seriously damage your system if you run it again.
2. Follow the suggested steps at the end of the installation to finalize your Seafile server installation.

## Troubleshooting
If your installation did not finish successfully, check `/root/[installer_name]_installation.log` for errors.

Alpha: Convert seafile.db (SQLite DB) to MySQL - **Use with extreme caution only**

This is only needed if your seafile-db was mistakenly created as SQLite database by one of the older installers. Only installations till end of May 2015 should be affected. To find out if you are affected, just run `find / -type f -name seafile.db -print`. If it finds the file we suggest converting your installation. You can use this script, but be cautios. **It is not very well tested and could seriously brake things.** Make a backup before running seafile-db-fixer... If you want to fix the problem manually, consult http://manual.seafile.com/deploy/migrate_from_sqlite_to_mysql.html for general instructions.

    cd /root
    wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seafile/seafile-server-installer/master/misc/seafile-db-fixer
    bash seafile-db-fixer
